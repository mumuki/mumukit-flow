# Mumukit::Flow

> An adaptative flow implementation for the Mumuki Platform

This gem implements an adaptative flow - on other ways, it responds to the question _what exercise should come next?_. It does not address other aspects of the platform like code evaluation, submission flow UI or feedback provision.

At glance, it supports four types of flow:

* `forward-flow`: how to get to more advanced exercises:
   * `continue`: go to next exercise
   * `fast-forwad`: go faster to more advanced exercies, by bypassing practice exercises when performing very well
* `backward flow`: how to revist previous exercises.
   * `revisit`: do exercises previously skipped by student
   * `retry`: re-do previously solved exercises that turned to be hard to pass

They are implemented as `Mumukit::Flow::Suggestion`s: `Mumukit::Flow::Suggestion::Continue`, `Mumukit::Flow::Suggestion::FastForward`, `Mumukit::Flow::Suggestion::Revisit` and `Mumukit::Flow::Suggestion::Retry`.
